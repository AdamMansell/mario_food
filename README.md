## **By Adam Mansell**

## Description
This is a Ruby/Rails website in which a one-to-many database relationship is worked with in order to properly create a user-friendly, functional website for Mario's store. The website consists of Products, and their Reviews, that both have full CRUD functionality.

## Setup

You should have Ruby installed in your machine.

Clone the repository from github:
```
> git clone https://github.com/AdamMansell/mario_food.git
```
Then `cd` into the repository:
```
> cd mario_food
```

Next, install the project dependencies:

```
bundle install
```

Create and populate the database with seed data:

```
> bundle exec rails db:setup
```

Run the Rails server:

```
bundle exec rails s
```

Visit: `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action!

You can run the spec tests by typing the following in the terminal:

```
